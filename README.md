# Notepad Cache Dumper

## 📜 Overview
**Notepad Cache Dumper** is a Python script that extracts text from unsaved Notepad session files stored in Windows. This tool is useful for recovering lost notes by scanning Notepad's cache folder and extracting readable text from `.bin` and `.bin.bak` files.

## 🔍 Features
- **Automated Recovery**: Finds and processes Notepad cache files.
- **Uses `strings64.exe`**: Extracts readable text from binary files.
- **Logs with Timestamp**: Provides clear logs for each step.
- **User-Friendly**: Displays progress and errors in a structured format.
- **Safe Execution**: Gracefully exits if required files or directories are missing.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **Identifies Notepad's cache directory** in Windows.
2. **Searches for `.bin` and `.bin.bak` files** where unsaved Notepad text might be stored.
3. **Runs `strings64.exe` on each file** to extract readable text.
4. **Saves extracted content** in a `Notepad Cache Dumps` folder.
5. **Displays progress and results** in the terminal.

## 🚀 Requirements
- Windows 10/11 with **Microsoft Store Notepad** installed.
- Python 3.x installed.
- `strings64.exe` (available in the same directory as the script).
- Administrator privileges may be required to access certain system files.
